These are my projects for the course Stochastic Differential Equations And Probabilistic Numeric Methods which is a last year course of engineering taught by Ms Blanchet at Ecole Centrale Lyon.

You will find 6 projects :

1. Exit time for a brownian motion : simulation of a BM and its first exit time (with probability of exit)
2. Equation of Fisher-Wright-Diffusion : simulation of approximate diffusion solutions by Euler scheme and Milstein scheme and comparison with the exact solution
3. Simulation of SDE approximations by Euler scheme and Milstein scheme and comparison with the solution, computation of the error
4.
